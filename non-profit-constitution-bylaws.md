Verily all praise is due to Allah سبحانه و تعالى – Glorious and exalted is He. We praise Him, seek His aid, ask for His forgiveness, and turn to Him in repentance. We seek refuge in Allah سبحانه و تعالىfrom the evil in our own souls and from our evil deeds. Whoever Allah سبحانه و تعالىguides, no one can misguide, and whoever He misguides, no one can guide him. We bear witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allah سبحانه و تعالىalone, without any partner. And we bear witness that Muhammad ﷺ – peace and blessings be upon him – is His servant and His messenger. May Allah سبحانه و تعالىsend praise and peace upon him, his family, his companions, and those who follow them in good to the Day of Judgement.
